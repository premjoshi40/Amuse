## 🎯 What Works (Frontend-Only Deployment)

✅ **Full UI/UX Experience**
- All visual elements and styling
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design

✅ **All Features with Mock Data**
- Browse artworks in galleries
- View detailed artwork information
- Add/remove favorites (saved in browser)
- Navigate through tours
- Use scanner simulation
- View AR simulation

✅ **Browser Storage**
- Favorites persist in localStorage
- Works offline once loaded

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

❌ **No Backend/Database**
- All data is hardcoded mock data
- Cannot add new artworks dynamically

❌ **Browser-Only Storage**
- Favorites saved in browser localStorage
- Not synced across devices
- Clearing browser data = losing favorites

❌ **No User Accounts**
- No authentication system
- No user profiles

These are expected for GitHub Pages static deployment!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Site shows 404 error
**Solution:** Wait 2-3 minutes after first deployment, then refresh

### Issue: Site loads but shows blank page
**Solution:** 
- Check browser console for errors
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution:** 
- All images use external URLs (should work automatically)
- Check your internet connection

### Issue: Favorites not saving
**Solution:**
- Favorites use localStorage (browser-only)
- Make sure cookies/storage are enabled
- Different browsers = different favorites

### Issue: Routes don't work (404 on page refresh)
**Solution:**
- Already fixed! Using HashRouter
- URLs will have `#` symbol (this is normal)
